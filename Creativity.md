- **Episodic Acute Stress**: Frequent instances of acute stress.
- **Eustress**: Positive stress that helps improve performance.
- **Distress**: Negative stress that leads to health problems.

Symptoms of stress can be categorized into physical, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms:

- **Physical Symptoms**: Headaches, fatigue, muscle tension, rapid heartbeat.
- **Emotional Symptoms**: Anxiety, irritability, depression, mood swings.
- **Cognitive Symptoms**: Memory problems, lack of concentration, negative thinking.

## 4. Situation-based question from conflict
Conflict situations vary widely; for example, in a workplace setting, a manager may need to mediate between two employees arguing over project responsibilities. The resolution may involve effective communication, compromise, and conflict management techniques.

## 5. Give an example of approach conflict.
**Approach conflict** occurs when a person faces two or more desirable choices. 

Example: A student has to choose between two equally good job offersâ€”one offering a high salary and the other providing a great work-life balance.

## 6. General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS)
Developed by Hans Selye, **General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS)** describes the body's response to stress in three stages:

1. **Alarm Stage**: The body perceives a threat, activating the fight-or-flight response.
2. **Resistance Stage**: The body attempts to cope with the stressor and restore balance.
3. **Exhaustion Stage**: Prolonged stress depletes energy, leading to burnout or illness.

## 7. Problem Stress or Acute Stress
- **Problem Stress** refers to stress caused by unsolved challenges or long-term unresolved issues.
- **Acute Stress** is a sudden reaction to an immediate threat, lasting for a short duration.

Example: A person experiencing acute stress might feel anxious before giving a presentation but recovers once it's over.

- **Physical Activities**: Exercise, yoga, deep breathing.
